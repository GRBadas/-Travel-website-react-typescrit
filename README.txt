This is a React application with a single-page layout, consisting of multiple components.

The App component is the main component that renders all the other components: ScrollToTop, Navbar, Hero, Services, Recommend, Testimonials, and Footer.

The Navbar component is a styled component that includes a logo, a toggle button, a list of navigation links, and a "Connect" button. It also includes a ResponsiveNav styled component, which is a dropdown menu that appears when the toggle button is clicked. The dropdown menu contains the same navigation links as the main menu.

The ScrollToTop component is responsible for displaying a button that, when clicked, scrolls the page to the top.

The Hero component displays a hero image and a call-to-action button.

The Services component displays information about the services offered by the website.

The Recommend component displays recommended destinations.

The Testimonials component displays testimonials from satisfied customers.

The Footer component displays social media icons and links, as well as copyright information.

The useEffect hook is used to animate the components using the scrollreveal library. When the component mounts, the scrollreveal object is created with some configuration options. Then, the sr.reveal() method is called on the desired elements with some animation options.
